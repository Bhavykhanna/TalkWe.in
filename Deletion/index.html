  <h1>Account & Data Deletion — TalkWe</h1>

  <p>
    TalkWe is designed with user privacy and control at its core.
    You can delete your account and associated personal data at any time.
  </p>

  <h2>Primary Method: Delete Your Account In-App</h2>
  <p>
    Account deletion is available directly within the TalkWe app for all logged-in users.
    This is the fastest and recommended method.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Open the TalkWe app</li>
    <li>Open your <strong>Profile</strong> page</li>
    <li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong></li>
    <li>Select <strong>Account</strong></li>
    <li>Tap <strong>Delete Account</strong></li>
    <li>Confirm the deletion</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Once confirmed, your account and associated personal data are
    <strong>deleted instantly and permanently</strong>.
    This action is irreversible.
  </p>

  <h2>Alternative Method: Email Request (If App Access Is Lost)</h2>
  <p>
    If you are unable to access the TalkWe app or have lost access in any manner,
    you may request account deletion by email.
  </p>

  <p>
    Send an email to <strong>support@talkwe.in</strong> with the subject line:
    <strong>“Request Deletion”</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    For security purposes, we may ask for limited information to verify account ownership.
    After verification, your account and associated data will be deleted within
    <strong>3 to 5 working days</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    A confirmation email will be sent once the deletion process is completed.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Deleted When You Delete Your Account</h2>
  <p>
    The following data is permanently removed when your account is deleted:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Your profile information</li>
    <li>Your authentication credentials</li>
    <li>Your public and private encryption keys</li>
    <li>Any server-side data associated with your account</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Note: Chat messages are stored locally on your device. Deleting your account does not automatically delete local chats on devices you still have access to.
    If you want to remove local chats, please delete them from your device or uninstall the app.
  </p>

  <h2>Data That May Be Retained</h2>
  <p>
    To preserve chat consistency for other users, TalkWe may retain a minimal
    amount of non-personal data:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      A randomly generated user ID (UUID) created by Firebase
      <em>(not linked to any personal identity)</em>
    </li>
    <li>
      Public encryption keys, allowing other users to retain access
      to their existing conversations
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This retained data contains no personal information and cannot be used
    to identify you.
  </p>

  <h2>No Automatic or Hidden Retention</h2>
  <p>
    TalkWe does not retain private user data after account deletion,
    except for the limited non-personal data described above.
    We do not sell, share, or reuse deleted data for any purpose.
  </p>

  <h2>Support</h2>
  <p>
    If you have any questions regarding account deletion or data handling,
    you can contact us through the TalkWe app or by emailing
    <strong>support@talkwe.in</strong>.
