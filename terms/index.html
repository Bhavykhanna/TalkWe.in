    <h1>Terms & Conditions — TalkWe <em>(Coming Soon)</em></h1>

    <p>
      By installing or using TalkWe, you agree to this Privacy Policy and Terms.
      If you do not agree, please do not use the app.
    </p>

    <h2>📄 PRIVACY POLICY — TalkWe</h2>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 2026<br>
      <strong>Version:</strong> 1
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for using TalkWe (“we,” “our,” “us”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, store, protect, and
      handle your information when you use TalkWe.<br>
      TalkWe is a secure messaging platform designed to let users communicate using end-to-end encryption (E2EE). To
      support infrastructure and development costs, the app may display advertisements.<br>
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Aim</h3>
    <p>
      Our goal is to provide a secure communication platform while collecting as little personal data as possible.
      Privacy in TalkWe is built by design, not by assumption.
      We do not read, store, or sell user conversations. We collect only what is necessary to operate the service and
      keep it reliable and sustainable.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h3>1. Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      TalkWe is designed for secure personal communication and ongoing development and learning. Limited commercial
      activity (such as advertising) may occur to support hosting and infrastructure costs.
    </p>
    <p>The main purpose of TalkWe is to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide secure 1-on-1 and group messaging</li>
      <li>Offer encrypted media sharing</li>
      <li>Allow customizable public profiles and group images</li>
      <li>Prioritise user privacy and data minimisation</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h3>About the Project & Future Features</h3>
    <p>
      TalkWe is an independent experimental project built and maintained by a single developer.
      It was created to fulfill a personal need for a messaging app that prioritises privacy, simplicity, and data
      minimisation — without sharing user data.
    </p>
    <p>
      While TalkWe is not open-source, development is user-driven. From time to time, users may be invited to share
      feedback or suggest features they would like to see in future updates. This helps guide the direction of the app
      while keeping privacy as the core principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      TalkWe is continuously evolving. Features may change, improve, or be refined over time as the app grows and
      real-world usage helps shape better decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’d like to know more about the project, share ideas, or discuss potential features, you’re welcome to reach
      out directly to the creator:

      <li>Email address (or phone number, if enabled) for login and recovery</li>
      <li>Display name</li>
      <li>Date of birth (DOB) for age verification</li>
      <li>Automatically generated UUID (internal user identifier)</li>
      <li>Profile image (unencrypted and publicly visible, if provided)</li>

      <li>Tracking IP addresses</li>
      <li>Hardware identifiers beyond Firebase default requirements</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h3>3. Public vs. Private Data</h3>

    <h4>Public Data (Not Encrypted)</h4>
    <p>Visible to other users:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Profile image</li>
      <li>Group profile image</li>
      <li>Display name / username</li>
      <li>Status message</li>
      <li>Group name and description</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Profile and group images are stored unencrypted to allow public visibility. Do not
      upload sensitive personal images.</p>

    <h4>Private Data (End-to-End Encrypted)</h4>
    <p>Protected using E2EE:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One-on-one messages</li>
      <li>Group messages</li>
      <li>Shared chat images</li>
      <li>Room encryption keys</li>
      <li>User encryption keys</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Only chat participants can decrypt this data.</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>4. User Consent</h3>
    <p>By sending messages or media through TalkWe, you consent to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>End-to-end encrypted processing of that content</li>
      <li>Secure delivery to intended recipients</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you do not agree, please avoid using features.</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>5. Encryption and Message Security</h3>
    <p>
      TalkWe uses a multi-layered end-to-end encryption (E2EE) system designed so that only intended recipients can read
      messages.
      TalkWe does not have access to readable messages, media, encryption keys, or backups.
    </p>

    <h4>User Encryption Keys</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Each user has a public key and a private key</li>
      <li>Private keys are securely stored in the Android Keystore</li>
      <li>Private keys never leave the device</li>
      <li>TalkWe cannot access or export private keys</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Temporary Key Backup (Device Switching)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>When switching devices, users may temporarily back up their encryption keys</li>
      <li>This backup:
          <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Is encrypted using the user’s Passkey</div>
          <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Is stored on the server for up to 48 hours</div>
          <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Cannot be read by TalkWe (Passkeys are never stored)</div>
      </li>
      <li>Once recovery is completed, the temporary backup is deleted instantly</li>
      <li>If the Passkey is lost or not provided, recovery is not possible</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Chat Room Encryption</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Each chat room has a unique secret room key</li>
      <li>The room key secures message-level encryption keys</li>
      <li>The room key is encrypted using each participant’s public key</li>
      <li>Only users with the matching private key can unlock it</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Message Encryption</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Every message uses a new, unique message key</li>
      <li>Message keys are protected by the room key</li>
      <li>Messages are digitally signed to verify authenticity</li>
      <li>Text messages are encrypted before transmission</li>
      <li>Media files are converted into encrypted binary data using the same process</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h3>Server Role</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>TalkWe servers act only as a secure relay</li>
      <li>Messages are temporarily held only for delivery</li>
      <li>Messages are deleted once delivered to all participants</li>
      <li>Undelivered messages are force-deleted after 5 days if a user remains inactive</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This prevents long-term storage and avoids delivering outdated messages.</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Backup Encryption</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Local backups contain already encrypted chats</li>
      <li>Backups are additionally encrypted using:
      
          <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. A strong AES encryption key</div>
          <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The AES key is encrypted using the user’s private key</div>
      
      </li>
      <li>Backup files remain unreadable without proper keys</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Even if accessed externally, backups cannot be read.</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>🔒 Encryption Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>
      While TalkWe uses end-to-end encryption and industry-standard cryptographic practices, no system can be guaranteed
      to be completely secure.
      TalkWe is not liable for any loss, exposure, or compromise of data — whether encrypted or unencrypted — resulting
      from factors beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device compromise, malware, or unauthorized access</li>
      <li>Loss or theft of a user’s device</li>
      <li>Weak device security or operating system vulnerabilities</li>
      <li>User actions, misconfiguration, or failure to maintain backups</li>
      <li>Third-party infrastructure or service failures</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      End-to-end encryption ensures TalkWe cannot read user data, however users remain responsible for securing their
      devices, Passkeys, and backup files.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h3>6. Local Chat Storage</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Chats are stored locally on the user’s device</li>
      <li>TalkWe does not store chat history on servers</li>
      <li>Servers are used only to relay encrypted messages</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h3>7. Local Backup & Restore</h3>
    <h4>Encrypted Local Backups</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Users can manually create encrypted backups from within the app</li>
      <li>Backups are generated as encrypted ZIP files</li>
      <li>Users choose where to store the file</li>
      <li>Backups are not automatic</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Media Backup (Optional)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Users may choose to include media in backups</li>
      <li>Including media significantly increases backup size</li>
      <li>If disabled, media will not be restored</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Restoring on a New Device</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Users must manually transfer the backup file</li>
      <li>During setup, the app prompts the user to select the file</li>
      <li>The file is used to restore eligible local data</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h3>8. Device Switching & App Uninstallation</h3>

    <h4>Switching to a New Device</h4>
    <p>To move your account safely:</p>
   
      <div>1. Create a fresh local chat backup (media optional; size may increase)</div>
      <div>2. Start the move process and create a Passkey</div>
      <div>3. Log in on the new device, enter the Passkey, and locate the backup file</div> 
    
    <p>If completed correctly, chats and data are restored as if nothing changed. Temporary recovery data is deleted
      automatically after successful recovery.</p>

    <h4>Uninstalling the App Without Backup</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>All local chats are permanently lost</li>
      <li>Encryption keys stored on the device are removed</li>
      <li>Chats cannot be recovered, even if a backup file exists</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is a direct result of TalkWe’s privacy-first E2EE design.</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>9. Account Deletion & Data Retention</h3>
    <p>
      Users may permanently delete their account at any time through in-app settings or via support if access is lost.
    </p>
    <p><strong>After deletion:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Profile and authentication data are removed</li>
      <li>Local data remains on the user’s device unless deleted by the user</li>
      <li>A UUID and public encryption keys may be retained solely to preserve chat integrity for other users</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This retained data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cannot identify the user</li>
      <li>Cannot restore the account</li>
      <li>Contains no personal information</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Deleted accounts cannot be recovered.</p>

    <hr>
